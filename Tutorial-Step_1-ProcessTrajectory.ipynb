    "# Generalized Network Analysis Tutorial - Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The Network Analysis Tutorial is part of the work entitled **Generalized correlation-based dynamical network analysis: a new high-performance approach for identifying allosteric communications in molecular dynamics trajectories**, by Marcelo C. R. Melo, Rafael C. Bernardi, Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez, and Zaida Luthey-Schulten. For more information see http://faculty.scs.illinois.edu/schulten/. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the Dynamic Network Analysis python package to explore the interactions between the OMP decarboxylase enzyme and its substrate, identifying clusters of amino acid residues that form domains, and active site residues that are important for binding and enzymatic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided in two jupyter notebooks. In this notebook, **Step 1**, we will analyze the MD trajectory for the OMP decarboxylase system and generate the network data used for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trajectory files have approximately 500MB in size, and must be downloaded [from this link](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/~rcbernardi/NetworkAnalysis/DynamicNetworkAnalysis_MDdata.tar.gz) and placed in the *TutorialData* folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the accompanying notebook, **Step 2**, we will load the data generated in the Step 1, and create analysis plots and visualizations of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Step 3**, which is outside of the jupyter notebook environment, we will produce high-quality renderings of the network using the popular visualization software VMD.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, please take some time to watch a video tutorial, such as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with VMD, you can find tutorials on how to use VMD here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use a language that is common among computational structural biophysicists. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The word **residue** is typically used to represent both an amino acid residue, or any other small molecule in the system, such as a ligand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word **segment** and also **segID** is typically used to represent a polymer chain, such as a protein, or a group of molecules in a lipid bilayer. Protein complexes would therefore be formed by multiple segments.\n"
